    "# Explain Greedy rule ?\n",
    "The Greedy rule is a problem-solving heuristic used in optimization and algorithm design. It involves making a series of choices, each of which looks best at the moment, with the hope that these local optimal choices will lead to a global optimum. The key characteristics of the Greedy rule include:\n",
    "1. **Local Optimal Choice**: At each step, the algorithm selects the option that seems best at that moment without considering the broader context.\n",
    "2. **Feasibility**: The choice must be feasible, meaning it must satisfy the problem's constraints.\n",
    "3. **Irrevocability**: Once a choice is made, it cannot be undone or changed later in the process.\n",
    "4. **Optimal Substructure**: The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, and the optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of these subproblems.\n",
    "5. **Greedy Choice Property**: A globally optimal solution can be arrived at by selecting a local optimum.  \n",
    "6. **Efficiency**: Greedy algorithms are often more efficient than other methods, such as dynamic programming or exhaustive search, because they do not require backtracking or exploring all possible solutions.\n",
    "7. **Applications**: Greedy algorithms are commonly used in problems like coin change, scheduling, minimum spanning trees, and Huffman coding.\n",
    "8. **Limitations**: While greedy algorithms can be effective for many problems, they do not always yield the optimal solution for every problem. Some problems require more complex approaches, such as dynamic programming or backtracking, to find the best solution.\n",
    "9. **Examples**: Classic examples of greedy algorithms include Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths, Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms for minimum spanning trees, and the Fractional Knapsack problem.\n",
    "10. **Implementation**: Greedy algorithms are typically implemented using iterative loops or recursive functions, depending on the problem structure, and they often involve sorting or priority queues to efficiently select the best option at each step.\n",
    "Overall, the Greedy rule is a powerful technique in algorithm design, particularly for problems where local choices lead to a globally optimal solution. However, it is essential to analyze the specific problem to determine if a greedy approach is appropriate, as it may not always yield the best results.\n",
    "11. **Complexity**: The time complexity of greedy algorithms can vary widely depending on the problem and the specific implementation, but they are generally efficient, often running in polynomial time.\n",
    "12. **Comparison with Other Algorithms**: Greedy algorithms are often compared with dynamic programming and backtracking algorithms. While greedy algorithms are simpler and faster for many problems, they may not always find the optimal solution, unlike dynamic programming, which guarantees an optimal solution by considering all possible combinations.\n",
    "13. **Greedy vs. Non-Greedy Algorithms**: Non-greedy algorithms, such as exhaustive search or dynamic programming, explore all possible solutions to ensure the best outcome, while greedy algorithms focus on immediate gains, which can lead to suboptimal solutions in some cases.\n",
    "14. **Real-World Applications**: Greedy algorithms are widely used in various fields, including computer science, operations research, economics, and network design, due to their simplicity and efficiency in solving many practical problems.\n",
    "15. **Examples of Greedy Problems**: Some common problems that can be solved using greedy algorithms include:\n",
    "   - **Activity Selection Problem**: Selecting the maximum number of activities that don't overlap.\n",
    "   - **Job Sequencing Problem**: Scheduling jobs to maximize profit with deadlines.\n",
    "   - **Huffman Coding**: Creating optimal prefix codes for data compression.\n",
    "   - **Minimum Spanning Tree**: Finding the minimum weight tree connecting all vertices in a graph.\n",
    "   - **Coin Change Problem**: Making change for a given amount using the fewest coins possible.\n",
